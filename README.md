# PlanSync

**Keep AI Agents and human developers in sync when plans change.**

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md)

## What problem does it solve?

In team projects, the biggest risk isn't coding — it's **information drift**. The Owner updates the plan, but someone is still working on the old version.

PlanSync fixes this:

- The Owner writes a Plan, breaks it into Tasks, and assigns them to members
- Members work directly from their AI tool (Cursor / Claude Code / Genie) — view tasks, claim tasks, report progress
- When the plan changes, affected members get a **Drift Alert** immediately

Everything happens through AI chat. No context switching required.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# ① Initialize (first time: install deps + start database + run migrations)
cd /path/to/PlanSync
npm run setup

# ② Start the API server
npm run dev

# ③ Connect your AI tool
./bin/plansync --host cursor    # Cursor
./bin/plansync --host claude    # Claude Code
./bin/plansync --host genie     # Genie (default)
```

For single-user local development, **zero configuration** is needed. Start chatting with your AI tool right away.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in a single **`.env`** file at the project root. The first `npm run setup` generates it from `.env.example`.

### Single user (local)

Nothing to change — defaults work out of the box.

### Team collaboration

Edit `.env` with the info from your Owner:

```bash
PLANSYNC_USER=alice                        # Your identity (default: system $USER)
PLANSYNC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.10:3001  # API address (skip for localhost)
PLANSYNC_SECRET=your-team-secret           # Auth secret (get from Owner)
```

The `bin/plansync` launcher reads `.env` automatically — no need to pass environment variables on the command line.

## Team Collaboration

### What the Owner does

1. Run `npm run setup` → `npm run dev` on the server
2. Set a `PLANSYNC_SECRET` in `.env`, share the **API address** and **secret** with the team
3. In AI chat, create the project and members:

```
> Create project "Login System"
> Add member alice (developer)
> Add member bob (developer)
```

4. Assign tasks:

```
> Create task "Implement login API", assign to alice
> Create task "Build login page UI", leave unassigned
```

> **Member names = identity credentials.** They must exactly match each member's `PLANSYNC_USER` (case-sensitive). When in doubt, ask them to run `echo $USER`.

### What members do

1. Get the API address and secret from the Owner
2. Edit `.env` (see "Team collaboration" example above)
3. Launch: `./bin/plansync --host cursor`
4. In AI chat:

```
> Show me my tasks
> Start task TASK-42
> Mark TASK-42 as done
```

### Task lifecycle

| Action               | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assign**           | Owner creates a task with an assignee; the member is notified |
| **Accept / Decline** | Members can accept and start, or decline to send it back      |
| **Claim**            | Unassigned tasks can be self-claimed                          |
| **Complete**         | Mark as done                                                  |

## Core Concepts

**Identity model** — No registration, no passwords. The Owner adds member names via `plansync_member_add`; members declare who they are by setting `PLANSYNC_USER` in `.env`. The system matches permissions and tasks by name. Names are case-sensitive.

**Roles** — **Owner**: creates projects, writes plans, manages members. **Developer / Agent**: claims tasks, does the work, reports progress.

**Drift Alert** — When a plan is updated, the system detects which tasks were created against an older version and notifies affected members. On receiving an alert, stop current work and assess the impact before continuing.

## NFS Environment Notes

This project is adapted for NFS-mounted filesystems:

- PostgreSQL data stored in `/tmp` (local disk, avoids NFS file-locking issues)
- npm cache redirected to `/tmp/npm-cache-$USER`
- MCP Server bundled with esbuild (avoids tsc OOM on NFS)
